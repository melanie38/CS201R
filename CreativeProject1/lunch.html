  <h1 class="mealTitle">Lunch</h1>
  <div class="frame">
  <p id="intro">"My life at home gives me absolute joy. There are some days when, as soon as you've finished cooking breakfast and cleaning up the kitchen, it's time to start lunch, and by the time you've done that, you're doing dinner and thinking, 'There has to be a menu we can order from." -  Julia Roberts</p>

  <div class="description">
  <h1>foolproof pizza crust</h1>
  <p>It all started when I married Mr Right. I LOVE cookies, but I felt bad filling the house with their yummy smell and letting the love of my life watch me as I would eat those gluten saturated "douceurs". That's how my quest for gluten free cookies that taste like the real deal started. I braced myself, ready to try as many recipes as needed but I got lucky. The google rescued. I found a recipe written by a great gluten free blogger, advertizing that she found THE perfect gluten free cookie recipe. I real all the comments, zoomed in all the pictures and decided to give it a shot. Suffice it to say that they are now our favorite guilt free (for me) cookies! Have fun trying it out!</p>

  <div class="ingredients">
  <h2 class="ing">ingredients</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>1 cup warm water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2-3 cups flour</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="instructions">
  <h2>instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl or in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the water, honey, oil, yeast and salt. Add the flour gradually until a soft dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. The exact flour amount will vary so go by the touch and feel of the dough versus the exact cup measurements in the recipe. The dough should be soft and smooth (not leaving a residue on your fingers but not super stiff, either).</li>
    <li>Knead the dough for 2-3 minutes (more like 5-6 minutes if kneading by hand or if using whole wheat flour).</li>
    <li>Let the dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Shape the dough into pizza(s), spread with sauce and toppings, and bake at 475 or 500 degrees on a preheated pizza stone or on a lightly greased baking sheet for 8-10 minutes</li>
